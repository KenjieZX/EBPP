            <p>The East Bali Poverty Project (EBPP) is a non-profit organisation 
                established in 1998 by a British resident of Bali after an appeal 
                for help by an isolated 7,200Ha mountain village, forgotten by 
                time and progress. Participatory community surveys in 1998 with 
                1,056 of the 3,000 families in 19 sub-villages revealed thousands 
                of people living in abject poverty without water, sanitation, roads, school

                <p>
                    We first communicated with Medic Mobile, a USA based NGO, in 2016 to discuss about e-health platform. A year after, MM helped us to design an Android smartphone app that can be used to monitor nutritional status of all children at posyandu. The idea was to help us and Puskesmas to collect weight and height data which is less time consuming and more efficient rather than using hand-writing. If any cases found, it would be easier to flag the issue and take-action. Since 2017, we have trained and monitored 54 nutrition cadres in 27 posyandu in Ban village & Puskesmas nutritionist to monitor infants’ nutritional status and flag any malnutrition issues (underweight, stunting and wasting) using the app and Analytics Dashboard. We terminated our Medic Mobile partnership in February 2021 because the Bali Government Health Department had their own digital health Android app.

The epicentre of this shallow earthquake was right under our village, causing extreme damage: 363 houses totally destroyed, 762 light-medium damage and 123 temples damaged. EBPP quickly started fundraising to provide all the materials and technical support for the 363 families whose houses were destroyed, to buildbamboo A-frame housesas temporary shelters until the government can provide the resources for permanent houses. Up to July 2022 they completed all 363 shelters.
